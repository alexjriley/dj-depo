## Deployment notes: Cloudinary

This project uses Cloudinary for media storage in production. Before deploying, make sure one of the following is set in the environment:

- `CLOUDINARY_URL` (recommended) — e.g. `cloudinary://<api_key>:<api_secret>@<cloud_name>`
- or the three separate vars: `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`, `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`, `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`

If you need to run management commands (for example `collectstatic`) in CI without production secrets, you can opt-in to skipping the Cloudinary credentials check by setting:

```
SKIP_CLOUDINARY_CHECK=1
```

This skip is conservative: it must be explicitly enabled and is intended for CI or build jobs where media uploads are not performed. Skipping will emit a warning in the process output so the decision is visible in logs. Do not rely on skipping for normal production deployments — ensure credentials are present for the running application.
